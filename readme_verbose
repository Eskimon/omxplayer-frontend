The instructions step by step, more verbose:

Do 'sudo aptitude install omxplayer'. - It refers to the installing of omxplayer itself.

Install webpy from pip. - The command is "sudo pip install web.py"

In your local repository (that's where the files like this readme are), create fifo pipe (mkfifo) called 'omxin'. - The command for this is "mkfifo omxin", you may need to sudo it, I'm not sure

Create symlink 'media' to the required location (containing movies, etc) to browse. - it needs to be called 'media' and be in the same location as omxplayerd. "ln -s <destination> media"

Add '@reboot cd path/to/repository; ./omxplayerd.py >/var/log/omxplayerd.log' or similar to root crontab file. - the command for opening the root crontab is "sudo crontab -e", it allows you to start things at certain times. In this case, at every reboot of the system.
